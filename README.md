# Customized-File-Synchronization-
This is a Bash script designed to synchronize the latest files from a source folder  to a destination folder on another remote server. It selectively copies only the files that do not already exist in the destination folder, making it a lightweight and efficient solution for transferring the most recent files between remote locations.
